            "['China, Japan hold ‘reset’ talks ahead of Abe’s U.S. visit. Trump’s decision to impose tariffs could bring the two closerThe decision of the U.S. to raise higher tariff walls is energising a dialogue between China and Japan — two countries that are already engaged in resetting their once-troubled ties. Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi has concluded a visit to Tokyo, ahead of the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to the U.S.Analysts say that the Chinese side took the initiative for spurring Mr. Wang’s visit. He participated in a high-level economic dialogue, which was held after a gap of eight years. Similar situation?“U.S. President Donald Trump has announced steep tariffs on Chinese goods, and could take further measures. While Xi is working on the U.S. directly to ease some of these tensions, the fact that Japan faces a similar, if less severe, challenge gives Beijing an opportunity to pull Tokyo closer to its orbit with the economic talks,” the Nikkei Asian Review reported on its website. Apparently, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan — President Xi Jinping’s right-hand man — spotted an early opportunity for Mr. Wang’s visit, as protectionist voices in Washington began to rumble in the region. A diplomatic source told The Hindu ahead of the talks that China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Japan’s Indo-Pacific blueprint are two vectors that both countries would need to address. “Japan is not averse to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), but at the same time, Tokyo would want Beijing to be respectful of Indo-Pacific framework. Japan is open to a dialogue with China on the Indo-Pacific,” the source said. Japan has proposed “a free and open Indo-Pacific” with the stated purpose of enhancing “connectivity” between Asia and Africa so as “to promote the stability and prosperity of the regions as a whole”. Japan sees India, Australia and the U.S. as its main partners in implementing the Indo-Pacific strategy. Observers point out that Mr. Abe is expected to have a conversation on the Indo-Pacific doctrine during his talks with Mr. Trump later in the week. Chinese Foreign Ministry in a statement on Mr. Wang’s visit advocated that Beijing and Tokyo should “safeguard economic globalisation and free trade system”. Besides, it said that China “welcomes and is glad to discuss Japan’s participation in the joint building of the ‘Belt and Road’ to make it a new growth point for bilateral cooperation”.Mr. Wang’s visit will be followed by Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang’s journey to Japan for a trilateral summit in May, in which South Korea would also participate. Mr. Abe is then expected to visit China for a much awaited summit with Mr. Xi. That would open the door for Mr. Xi’s visit to Japan, probably next year. Mr. Wang’s visit also provided an opportunity to the Japanese to be briefed about the Beijing visit of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, ahead of his proposed summit with Mr. Trump, which could take place next month.', 'Japan PM vows to step up China ties but bolster defense . Abe said Japan-China relations have returned to “normal” since he visited Beijing in October and he now wants to further promote their cooperation in trade and other areas. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged on Monday he will further expand his country’s already improving ties with China but said Japan still needs to bolster its defense capability as far as space amid concern about Chinese military activity and uncertainty over North Korea’s denuclearization. In a policy speech to Parliament, Mr. Abe omitted references to South Korea, which he had routinely mentioned as Japan’s most important neighbor, as Tokyo tries to distance itself amid escalating spats over history and alleged incidents between the two defense forces. Mr. Abe said Japan-China relations have returned to “normal” since he visited Beijing in October and he now wants to further promote their cooperation in trade and other areas. “Japan-China relations have fully returned to a normal orbit,” Mr. Abe said. “I will elevate it to a next level by deepening exchanges in every area in all levels.” Apparently drawn closer amid shared trade friction with the U.S., the two Asian rivals have improved their ties since a low in 2012 during a dispute over east China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China. Yet, Japan still needs to expand defense capability, especially in space and cyberspace, Mr. Abe said. Japan has repeatedly said China’s growing military presence threatens regional security and its recent rapid advancement in space technology is an additional concern. Japanese officials have also said North Korea remains a missile and nuclear threat since it has not taken concrete steps except for a vague promise it made at the June summit with the U.S. Japan, under pressure from President Donald Trump’s demand for more American imports, is to start trade talks with Washington later this year. Japan has already increased purchases of expensive U.S. missile defense systems and other arms. Maintaining good ties with China is one of most important diplomatic goals for Mr. Abe, but analysts said it may be affected by how things work out between the United States and China. “Even if Prime Minister Abe wants to further improve Japan-China relations, it would be influenced by U.S.-China relations,” said Harukata Takenaka, international politics professor at National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. “It would be difficult for Japan to make a decision by itself.” Mr. Abe did not mention South Korea as the key U.S. allies and close economic partners are currently locked in disputes over military issues and wartime history. Japan’s Defense Ministry is reportedly considering not participating in a multinational defense exercise planned in South Korea this spring. Mr. Abe said he seeks to achieve unresolved postwar legacies during his leadership settling island disputes and signing peace treaty with Russia and normalizing relations with North Korea, while cooperating with other countries toward achieving the North’s nuclear and missile program abandonment. The Soviet Union took the four southernmost Kuril Islands during the final days of World War II. Japan asserts territorial rights to the islands, which it calls the Northern Territories, and the dispute has kept the countries from signing a peace treaty. Mr. Abe has held dozens of meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent years in a bid to solve the dispute, and they agreed in November to accelerate negotiations based on a 1956 Soviet proposal to return two of the islands to Japan. Their talks this month in Moscow produced little progress. The parliament’s ordinary session lasts for 150 days until late June. Mr. Abe, who took office in December 2012 and is serving his third term, seeks to lead his party to win parliamentary elections in July and strengthen his grip on power until 2021 or possibly beyond.', 'Trump breaks with Abe, says not bothered by North Korea missile tests. During hours of talks at Japan’s Akasaka Palace, Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe also deliberated over economic issues, including trade and Iran, but North Korea’s recent firing of short-range missiles emerged as an area of disagreement President Donald Trump said on Monday that he is not “personally bothered” by recent short-range missile tests that North Korea conducted this month, breaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is hosting the president on a four-day state visit full of pageantry. Standing beside Mr. Trump at a news conference after hours of talks, Mr. Abe disagreed with the U.S. president, saying the missile tests violated U.S. Security Council resolutions and were “of great regret” Mr. Mr. Abe, who has forged a strong friendship with Mr. Trump and agrees with him on many issues, is concerned because the short-range missiles pose a threat to Japan’s security. Mr. Trump was invited to Japan to be the first world leader to meet with its new emperor. Despite being far from Washington, he didn’t miss the chance to lob another broadside against former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democrats seeking to challenge Mr. Trump in next year’s presidential election. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un recently criticized Mr. Biden as having a low I.Q. and Mr. Trump told the world he agreed with the authoritarian leader’s assessment. Mr. Abe is hosting Mr. Trump on a State visit designed to highlight the U.S.-Japan alliance and showcase the warm relations between the leaders. During hours of talks at Japan’s Akasaka Palace, Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe also deliberated over economic issues, including trade and Iran, but North Korea’s recent firing of short-range missiles emerged as an area of disagreement. When asked if he was bothered by Pyongyang’s short-range missile tests, Mr. Trump said- “No, I’m not. I am personally not.” The President has sought to downplay the significance of the missile tests, despite the fact that his own national security adviser, John Bolton, said over the weekend that they violated U.N. resolutions. Mr. Trump continues to hold out hope of eventually getting Mr. Kim to agree to give up his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, despite two summits he’s had with the North Korean leader that produced no concrete pledge to denuclearize the peninsula. Mr. Trump praised Mr. Kim, calling him a “smart man” who might have launched the missiles earlier this month to “get attention.” “All I know is there have been no nuclear tests, no ballistic missiles going out, no long-range missiles going out and I think that someday we’ll have a deal,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he is in “no rush.” Mr. Trump is correct when he said North Korea has not recently tested a long-range missile that could reach the U.S. But earlier this month, North Korea fired off a series of short-range missiles that alarmed U.S. allies in closer proximity to North Korea, including Japan. The tests broke a pause in North Korea’s ballistic missile launches that began in late 2017. Mr. Abe reiterated his previous statement that the tests were carried out in defiance of the U.N. “This is violating the Security Council resolution,” Mr. Abe said, adding that, as North Korea’s neighbor, Japan feels threatened. “It is of great regret. But at the same time between Kim Jong Un and President Trump a certain new approach was taken and that is something that I pay tribute to.”Earlier on Monday, Mr. Trump said he backed Mr. Abe’s interest in leveraging his country’s good relations with Iran to help broker a possible dialogue between the U.S. and its nemesis in the Middle East. Mr. Abe said he is willing to do whatever he can to help to reduce escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe discussed the issue earlier on Monday. Mr. Abe could visit Iran next month. “Peace and stability of (the) Middle East is very important for Japan and the United States and also for the international community as a whole,” Mr. Abe said. The leaders held hours of talks after the U.S. president at Mr. Abe’s invitation became the first world leader to meet Japan’s new emperor, Naruhito, who ascended to the throne May 1. The meeting with Naruhito and his wife, Empress Masako, was preceded by a grand outdoor welcome ceremony at Japan’s Imperial Palace, where Mr. Trump walked solo across red carpets, reviewing Japanese troops as the guest of honor.‘Not a fan of Biden’.Mr. Trump’s official visit also included golf with Mr. Abe, presenting a trophy to a sumo wrestling champion and dinner in Tokyo with their wives. The visit came with hours of one-on-one time for Trump and Abe, who has been trying to remain on Trump’s good side despite disagreements between them on trade and other issues. Mr. Trump didn’t hold back at the news conference when he was asked about Mr. Biden, declaring himself “not a fan.” “Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-I.Q individual,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Kim probably based his assessment on Mr. Biden’s record and “I probably agree with him on that.” U.S. officeholders usually avoid engaging in politics while on foreign soil, hewing to the adage that politics stops at the water’s edge. But Mr. Trump’s sharp attack on Mr. Biden, though his declaration of agreement with Kim, set aside that long-standing norm. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe largely glossed over their difference on trade, despite the potentially crippling tariffs on foreign autos that Mr. Trump is threatening to impose on Japan and the European Union. Mr. Trump declined to say what Japan would have to do to avoid those tariffs, but complained of an “unbelievably large” trade imbalance with the nation. Still, he said he expects to reach trade deals at some point with both Japan and China, but wouldn’t rush it. “I think we will have a deal with Japan. Likewise, I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future,” he said. Mr. Trump has tried to pressure China by slapping tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.“I don’t believe that China can continue to pay these really hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,” he said. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet during a world leaders’ summit next month in Osaka, Japan.', 'Quake in northern Japan kills two, causes landslides, blackout. 6.7-magnitude earthquake struck southern Hokkaido at 3:08 a.m. at the depth of 40 kilometresA powerful earthquake rocked Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido early on Thursday, triggering landslides that crushed homes, knocking out power and forcing a nuclear power plant to switch to a backup generator. The magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck southern Hokkaido at 3:08 a.m. at the depth of 40 kilometres (24 miles), Japan’s Meteorological Agency said. The epicenter was east of the city of Tomakomai but the shaking buckled roads and damaged homes in Hokkaido’s prefectural capital of Sapporo, with a population of 1.9 million.

He did not give details. Japan is used to dealing with disasters, but the last few months have brought a string of calamities. The quake came on the heels of a typhoon that wreaked havoc in western Japan, leaving the main airport near Osaka and Kobe closed after a tanker rammed a bridge connecting the facility to the mainland. The summer also brought devastating floods from torrential rains in Hiroshima and deadly hot temperatures across the country. The Japanese national broadcaster NHK, citing its own tally, reported that 125 people were injured and nearly 40 are feared missing. Hokkaido’s local disaster agency put the number of injured at 48. Several people were reported missing in the nearby town of Atsuma, where a massive landslide engulfed homes in an avalanche of soil, rocks and timber. Reconstruction Minister Jiro Akama told reporters that five people were believed to be buried in the town’s Yoshino district. Some of the 40 people stranded there were airlifted to safer grounds, NHK said. Aerial views showed dozens of landslides in the surrounding area, with practically every mountainside a raw slash of brown amid deep green forest. Airports and many roads on the island were closed following the early morning quake. NHK showed workers rushing to clean up shattered glass and reinstall ceiling panels that had tumbled down in the region’s biggest airport at Chitose.

NHK showed the moment the quake struck the city of Muroran, with its camera violently shaking and all city lights going black moment later. In Sapporo, a mudslide on a road left several cars half buried. Power was knocked out for Hokkaido’s 2.9 million households. Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters that the extensive power outage was caused by an emergency shutdown of the main thermal power plant at Tomato Atsuma that supplies half of Hokkaido’s electricity. The hope had been to get power back up “within a few hours,” Mr. Seko said. However, damage to three generators at the Tomato Atsuma plant means that the restoration of power could take more than a week. Mr. Seko said utilities were planning to start up several other thermal and hydroelectric plants to provide at least some power. Altogether peak demand on the island averages 3.8 million kilowatts, stopgap supplies from smaller plants and from the nearby Tohoku region could bring supplies up to 2.9 million kilowatts within days, Mr. Seko said. However, that would leave a shortfall of roughly 900,000 kilowatts, causing inconveniences to many in Hokkaido. In the meantime, authorities sent power-generator vehicles to hospitals so enable them to treat emergency patients, he said. Reacting quickly to the disaster, troops deployed water tanker trucks in Sapporo, where residents were collecting bottles to tide them over until electricity and tap water supplies come back online.

To the north, in the scenic town of Biei, residents lined up outside of supermarkets and convenience stores, quickly clearing shelves of water, toilet paper and food.“Only a few cartons of instant ramen were left,” said Mika Takeda, who lives in the town of 10,000. The one local gas station was limiting customers to only 20 liters (5 gallons) of gas, she said. As Japan’s northern frontier and a major farming region with rugged mountain ranges and vast forests, Hokkaido is an area where residents are used to coping with long winters, isolation and other hardships. But the blackouts brought on by the quake underscore the country’s heavy reliance on vulnerable power systems- without electricity, water was cut to many homes, train lines were idled and phone systems stopped in some areas. Mr. Suga said authorities were doing their utmost to rescue and assess damage after receiving hundreds of calls about people missing and buildings collapsing. The Central government set up a crisis management taskforce at the Prime Minister’s office. Three reactors at the Tomari nuclear plant were offline for routine safety checks, but they are running on backup generators that kicked in after losing external power because of the island-wide blackouts, Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority said. Spent fuel in storage pools was safely cooled on backup power that can last for a week, the agency said. The powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 that hit northeast Japan destroyed both external and backup power to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, causing meltdowns.', 'China, Japan to partner in building Asia infrastructure . Abe to hold talks with President Xi and Prime Minister LiJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has arrived in China on a reset visit that is expected to trigger significant collaboration between Tokyo and Beijing in developing infrastructure in Asia. Soon after his arrival, Mr. Abe was accorded a reception, hosted by his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang, at the Great Hall of the People. The function was held to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the China-Japan treaty of friendship.“Japan and China are playing an indispensable role in the economic development of not just Asia but the world,” Mr. Abe said during his speech at the function. Mr. Abe will be accorded a ceremonial welcome on Friday morning and will hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping later in the day. “This is a breakthrough visit, important not just for the China-Japan relations, but whose significance would be felt in the region and the world,” Huang Jing, Dean of the International and Regional Studies Center at the Beijing Language and Culture University, told The Hindu. During Mr. Abe’s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li, the leaders are expected to seek areas of convergence between China’s Belt and Road Initiative and Japan’s concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific. Analysts say that they are expected to discuss joint development of infrastructure in Asia and Africa during talks. Tagged with politically benefiting from “debt traps” through its loans to developing countries, China is particularly keen to work together with reputed Japanese financial firms in third countries. The overhang of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, as well as U.S. restrictions on Japanese exports of steel and aluminum, are expected to shape the conversation between Mr. Abe and his Chinese interlocutors. “There are structural reasons why Mr. Abe wants closer ties not just with China but other significant players such as Russia and India. He senses the decline in U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific, which is a major factor persuading him to re-define Japan’s role in the region,” Professor Huang observed. Ahead of his arrival, Mr. Abe told China’s Xinhua news agency and other state media that Japan-China ties were advancing towards a “new phase,” following his meetings with President Xi, including September talks with the Chinese leader in Vladivostok, during a forum where joint development of Russia’s Far East and Northeast Asia was in focus. The Nikkei Asian Review is reporting that Japan and China are expected to promote around 50 private-sector, third-country infrastructure projects this week, setting in motion the first joint deal of building a smart city in Thailand as early as this year. “The two countries see third-country infrastructure as a cornerstone of their growing economic cooperation,” the daily observed.', \"Japan to buy more stealth jets, radar to counter China, Russia. The plans are the clearest indication yet of Japan's ambition to become a regional power as a military build-up by China and a resurgent Russia puts pressure on its U.S. ally. Japan will accelerate spending on advanced stealth fighters, long-range missiles and other equipment over the next five years to support U.S. forces facing China's military in the Western Pacific, two new government defence papers said. The plans are the clearest indication yet of Japan's ambition to become a regional power as a military build-up by China and a resurgent Russia puts pressure on its U.S. ally.“The United States remains the world's most powerful nation, but national rivalries are surfacing and we recognise the importance of the strategic competition with both China and Russia as they challenge the regional order,” said a 10-year defence programme outline approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government on Tuesday. The United States, followed by China, North Korea and Russia, are the countries that most influenced Japan's latest military thinking, the paper said. China, the world's second biggest economy, is deploying more ships and aircraft to patrol waters near Japan, while North Korea has yet to fulfil a pledge to dismantle its nuclear and missile programmes. Russia, which continues to probe Japanese air defences, said on Monday it had built new barracks for troops on a northern island it captured from Japan at the end of World War Two. More stealth fightersJapan plans to buy 45 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 stealth fighters, worth about $4 billion, in addition to the 42 jets already on order, according to a separate five-year procurement plan approved on Tuesday. The new planes will include 18 short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) B variants of the F-35 that planners want to deploy on Japanese islands along the edge of the East China Sea. The islands are part of a chain stretching past Taiwan and down to the Philippines that has marked the limit of Chinese military dominance east of the disputed South China Sea.“Japan's decision to acquire more F-35s is a testament to the aircraft's transformational capability and its increasing role in promoting regional stability and enhancing the US-Japan security alliance,” Lockheed Martin said in a statement. The navy's two large helicopter carriers, the Izumo and Kaga, will be modified for F-35B operations, the paper said. The 248-metre (814 ft) long Izumo-class ships are as big as any of Japan's aircraft carriers in World War Two. They will need reinforced decks to withstand the heat blast from F-35 engines and could be fitted with ramps to aid short take-offs, two defence ministry officials told Reuters. Trade war threatThe new F-35 order may also help Japan avert a trade war with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose tariffs on Japanese car imports, thanked Mr. Abe for buying the F-35s when the two met at a summit in Argentina this month. Other U.S.-made equipment on Japan's shopping list includes two land-based Aegis Ashore air defence radars to defend against North Korean missiles, four Boeing Co KC-46 Pegasus refuelling planes to extend the range of Japanese aircraft, and nine Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye early-warning planes. Japan plans to spend 25.5 trillion yen ($224.7 billion) on military equipment over the next five years, 6.4 percent higher than the previous five-year plan. Cost-cutting will free up another 2 trillion yen for purchases, the procurement paper said. Japan only spends about 1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence, but the size of its economy means it already has one of the world's largest militaries.“The budget is increasing and there has been an acceleration to deploy capability as soon as possible,” Robert Morrissey, head of Raytheon Co's unit in Japan, said this month. Wary of North Korean promises to abandon ballistic missile development, Japan's military is buying longer-range Raytheon SM-3 interceptor missiles to strike enemy warheads in space. The defence papers assessed non-traditional military threats as well. A new joint-forces cyber unit will bolster Japan's defences against cyber attacks. More electronic warfare capabilities are planned. Japan's air force will also get its first space unit to help keep tabs on potential adversaries high above the Earth's atmosphere. ($1 = 113.4800 yen)\", 'China, Japan pivot to new markets to counter trade-war headwinds . The meeting between the two leaders was followed by the signing of a slew of agreements. Faced with the threat of a trade war with the United States, China and Japan have decided to work together to develop new overseas markets, by focusing on collaboration instead of competing with each other.“Turning to cooperation from competition, the relationship between the two nations is entering a new stage,” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said a joint press conference with his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang on Friday. Prime Minister Li endorsed how ties between the two countries had pivoted from full-blown rivalry to growing partnership, especially over the last two years. Mr. Li spotlighted that “we (China and Japan) are cooperation partners to each other and not a threat, and we support each other for peaceful development”.In his brief remarks, the Japanese Prime Minister nailed that joint forays in third countries would now be one of the new templates of Tokyo-Beijing ties.“We have set up a new mechanism of cooperation between China and Japan in third party markets. Over 1000 business representatives from the two nations gathering and signing multiple cooperation documents is one good example,” he observed. Analysts say that the Japanese Prime Minister’s remarks showcase his “pragmatism,” notwithstanding his strong nationalistic instincts. “Despite being proud Japanese, I think Mr. Abe is also a very pragmatic politician,” Huang Jing, Dean of International and Regional Studies Center at the Beijing Language and Culture University told The Hindu. Japan’s Kyodo news agency is reporting that by bolstering investment in other countries, the governments of Asia\\'s two biggest economies will aim to form a new model of economic cooperation between them. The meeting between the two leaders was followed by the signing of a slew of agreements, which covered energy cooperation, military confidence building measures in the East China Sea, infrastructure development and joint development of hi-end technology. Focusing on cutting-edge know-how, an agreement was signed to establish a discussion platform on hi-end technology and intellectual property. The Chinese side hopes that such a forum would help make-up possible shortages of U.S. components, in case the Beijing-Washington trade and technology war escalates. The two sides also signed an agreement on joint development of gas fields in the East China Sea—an initiative that was stalled in 2008, when tensions over islands, called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, spiraled. A decision has also been taken to launch joint search and rescue missions in these waters. Analysts say that China seeks Japanese companies to participate in its Belt and Road projects, especially in the financial sphere, to counter allegations that Beijing is deliberately pursuing “debt trap” diplomacy as tool for exercising political control in developing countries. By entering into joint ventures, Japanese firms hope they can revive their flagging fortunes in new opportunity areas. The two countries also signed a bilateral currency swap dealt of $ 26.7 billion—around 10 times as larger than a previous agreement that has expired. Mr. Abe said that Japan and China agreed to work together to open a hotline as soon as possible. That would help avert accidental clashes at sea and in the air. He stressed that the East China Sea should become a \"sea of peace, cooperation and friendship.\" On North Korea, the two leaders reiterated that denuclearisation of North Korea was necessary. Mr. Abe said that Tokyo and Beijing will “fulfill responsibilities” for peace and stability in East Asia.', 'Japan faces critics, conflict on environment issues at G20. Japan touts an enviable waste management system, and 86 % of its plastic waste is recycled. G20 host Japan hopes world leaders will endorse a deal on marine plastic waste and find common ground on climate change, but its own environmental record is under increasing scrutiny. Activists say Japan has fallen behind on reducing plastic consumption and is caving to U.S. pressure to water down language on climate change to achieve a unanimous statement on the issue. Japan, chair of this week\\'s Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, has already secured agreement from environment ministers on a marine plastic waste deal that will be endorsed this week. A mounting problem: About 80% of the plastic waste is dumped in ocean, posing a threat to marine life. | Photo Credit: FILE PHOTO K_R_DEEPAK The deal commits G20 members to reducing plastic waste but includes few details on how that will be achieved, proposing only voluntary steps and yearly progress reports. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said last month the issue would be \"one of the most important themes of the G20\", adding that Japan \"hopes to play a leadership role\".But while campaigners say the agreement — the first on the issue bringing together rich and developing nations — is a \"first step\", they argue it should be more ambitious.\"Legally binding international rules with clear timelines and goals\" are needed, Yukihiro Misawa, plastic policy manager of environmental group WWF Japan, told AFP.Experts welcomed part of the agreement that calls for research to better understand where plastic is coming from and how to tackle it.\"Scientific knowledge should be the foundation of an international deal, so that\\'s good,\" professor Atsuhiko Isobe of Kyushu University\\'s Center for Oceanic and Atmospheric Research told AFP.Japan as a role model?The agreement comes as campaigners criticise Japan for moving too slowly on reducing plastic consumption, particularly as the country produces more plastic waste per capita than any nation apart from the United States. Japan touts an enviable waste management system, and 86% of its plastic waste is recycled. But much of that \"recycling\" involves simply incinerating plastic, often to produce energy, a process that generates carbon dioxide and contributes to climate change. Japan exports around 10% of its plastic waste for recycling overseas. But research by environmentalists shows the waste can end up in the ocean or being burned improperly, emitting harmful pollutants. Last month, Japan announced a new strategy to reduce plastic waste, including plans to eventually require retailers to charge for plastic bags, but that still leaves it far behind nations that have simply banned plastic bags and other single-use plastic outright.\"What is expected of Japan is to behave as a role model,\" said Isobe. Climate change conflict. Japan also faces growing scrutiny on climate change issues because of its continued use of coal. It is one of nearly 200 nations that signed the Paris climate agreement, which commits signatories to efforts to cap global warming at \"well below\" two degrees Celsius. But earlier this month, it said it would continue to rely on coal-burning power plants and set its target date for carbon-neutral status after 2050. Greenpeace said that showed Japan was \"not truly serious about mitigating climate change\".And Tokyo will likely face additional pressure over the climate change portion of the G20 final communique. A document described as a draft of the communique\\'s climate language, seen by AFP, omits any reference to reducing use of fossil fuels and removes wording in previous G20 statements describing the Paris deal as \"irreversible\".At last year\\'s G20, that phrase was included but not endorsed by the United States, which added wording reiterating \"its decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement\".The draft document, which could change substantially before adoption, suggests an attempt to find neutral language that Washington can endorse, but activists said it would dilute international efforts.\"The draft statement reflects how very weak is Japan\\'s willingness to fight against climate change and this risks undermining global efforts,\" said Kimiko Hirata, director of Kiko Network Japan, an environmental group.\"For this G20, members have to show strong leadership by committing to ambitious actions,\" she told AFP.And France\\'s President Emmanuel Macron has already said he will not sign any statement that does not include ambitious climate language, calling the issue a \"red line\".', 'Bilateral visits set to deepen China-Japan ties .  China and Japan appear set for a long-term engagement, based on a two-track approach, where Tokyo’s decision to build its military muscle can be leveraged to negotiate with Beijing from a position of strength. Japan’s long-term strategy to bond with Beijing on the basis of parity was apparent in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s address to parliament, which convened for a 150-day session on Monday. The Nikkei Asian Review is reporting that Mr. Abe reiterated Japan’s readiness to push ahead with his “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy,” which pursues stability and prosperity on the basis of an international rules-based order in the region. The report highlighted that the Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy policy was “originally” seen as aimed at addressing China’s maritime assertiveness, signalling a shift in stance. It added, “But (Mr.) Abe also said Japan will cooperate with Beijing to meet growing demand for building infrastructure in Asia, bearing in mind President Xi Jinping’s “One Belt, One Road” cross-border infrastructure initiative.”Diplomatic sources told The Hindu that in Japanese perception, the Indo-Pacific doctrine was not focused on China’s so-called “containment”. Instead it was an expression of anxiety regarding the uninterrupted flow of trade along important regional sea lanes. Mr. Abe said that Japan and China were “inseparable,” countries. He added that Japan “will seek to meet the expectations of the international community by developing friendly relations (with China) in a stable manner.”Mr. Abe expressed his resolve to have reciprocal visits between him and Chinese President Xi Jinping “as soon as possible”. This would be in tune with the 40th anniversary of the peace and friendship treaty between the two countries. The sources said that the process of reciprocal visits could begin with Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang’s visit to Japan for a trilateral meeting of China, Japan and South Korea. That could be followed by a visit to China by Mr. Abe. Mr. Abe’s arrival in Beijing would set the stage for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s return visit to Japan. Next year, Mr. Xi is also expected to visit Japan, which would host the G-20 summit, the sources said. On its part, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has cautiously welcomed the possibility of a flurry of top level exchanges between China and Japan. In response to a question on Mr. Abe’s remarks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, on Tuesday said, “With the principle of wide consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, China stands ready to work with Japan and other parties to promote the Belt and Road initiative and achieve common development and prosperity of countries in this region.”In his policy speech, Mr. Abe exhorted law makers to prepare for major amendments in Japan’s existing pacifist-constitution. “We will be creating our nation, looking ahead 50 years or 100 years. It is the Constitution that narrates the shape and ideal form of the country,” he observed. Mr. Abe’s express resolve to revamp Japan’s defence capability, including introduction of land-based Aegis Ashore missile defence system, citing the threat from North Korea. Mr. Abe’s directional address has been preceded by a visit to China in late December by Toshihiro Nikai, number two in Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). During his stay Mr. Nikai had met Mr. Xi and invited him to visit Tokyo, Kyodo news agency had reported. In a rare address to the Communist Party of China (CPC) Party School, Mr. Nikai underscored that that the two countries must forge a future-oriented cooperative relationship. He said that a bilateral “mutually beneficial relationship,” should transition to shape peace and prosperity in Asia and beyond.', 'Ties with Japan will grow stronger, says Narendra Modi. Says there is respect for each other’s culture and civilisation and a sense of belonging and goodwill Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that ties between India and Japan had become stronger from the time the two countries cooperated to make a car to coming together to manufacture a bullet train. Addressing the Indian community in this Japanese city, Mr. Modi said Japan had played an important role in India’s economic development. Mr. Modi said the bilateral ties are going to become more robust as India aimed to become a $5-trillion economy in the next five years.“There was a time when we were collaborating in building cars and today we are collaborating in building a bullet train,” Mr. Modi said. Indelible mark. “Today, there is no such part of India where Japan’s projects or investments have not left its mark. Similarly, talent and manpower of India are contributing to strengthen Japan,” he told the enthusiastic Indian diaspora who gave a rousing welcome to the Prime Minister. India is planning to run its first bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad with Japan’s help. Mr. Modi thanked the Indian diaspora for being part of the world’s largest democratic process, which saw the participation of 61 crore voters. “When it comes to India’s relationship with the world, Japan has an important place in it. This relationship is dated back to centuries. There is a sense of belonging, goodwill and respect for each other’s culture and civilisation,” he said.“Almost two decades ago, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the then Japanese premier, Yoshiro Mori, together made our relationship as a global partnership. After becoming Prime Minister in 2014, I got a chance to strengthen our friendship with my dear friend Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. This relationship will become stronger in New India,” he said. Thanking the Indian diaspora for playing a vital role in the recently concluded Indian elections, in which he was voted back to power with a stronger mandate, the Prime Minister said while several Indians from Japan worked on the field, many used social media to spread the message of the democratic process.']\n",
